    The database of ”Molecular Models of the Boltzmann-Zuse Society” contains force ﬁelds for around 150 substances for
    low-molecular ﬂuids, in particular for the ﬂuid region. The models were developed over the last 20 years by members
    of the Boltzmann Zuse Society for Computational Molecular Engineering (BZS) and published <a href="reflist.php"
                                                                                                 target="_blank">here</a>.
    They are known to describe vapour-liquid equilibrium data (saturated densities, vapour pressure, enthalpy of
    vaporization) well, to which they were parametrised (in most cases). In many cases, also predictions of other
    properties, like transport properties were tested and found to be in good agreement with experimental data. All
    force ﬁelds in the database are: rigid multi-centre Lennard-Jones 12-6 potentials with super-imposed point charges,
    dipoles, and quadrupoles. They can easily be combined for describing mixtures using mixing rules, e.g. the
    Lorentz-Berthelot rule.
    <br/> In some cases, multiple models for the same substance were developed, e.g. for methane (one model as a simple
    Lennard-Jones ﬂuid and one as Lennard-Jones truncated & shifted). The database also contains a set of ion models
    that can be used for modelling electrolyte systems, which are highlighted blue in the molecule list.
